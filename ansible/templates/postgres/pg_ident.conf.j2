#
# If SYSTEM-USERNAME starts with a slash (/), it will be treated as a
# regular expression.  Optionally this can contain a capture (a
# parenthesized subexpression).  The substring matching the capture
# will be substituted for \1 (backslash-one) if present in
# PG-USERNAME.
#
# Multiple maps may be specified in this file and used by pg_hba.conf.
#
# No map names are defined in the default configuration.  If all
# system user names and PostgreSQL user names are the same, you don't
# need anything in this file.
#
# This file is read on server startup and when the postmaster receives
# a SIGHUP signal.  If you edit the file on a running system, you have
# to SIGHUP the postmaster for the changes to take effect.  You can
# use "pg_ctl reload" to do that.

# Put your actual configuration here
